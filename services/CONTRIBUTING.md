# Ground Rules
### There are no rules! :D (Besides the select few) 
This project is intended for users to have fun and create thier own versions of SportsDrop based off the initial master branch. Therefore,
we advise users to fork thier own repositories and upload to fresh new branches so as not interfere with either the master branch or other developer branches.

> Responsibilities
> * DO NOT MODIFY AND COMMIT TO THE MASTER BRANCH. THIS BRANCH WILL BE ROUTINELY OVERWRITTEN TO REFLECT THE BASE TEMPLATE.
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Ubuntu Linux, Android and iOS, Chrome Browser and Safari.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. 

# Your First Contribution

> Unsure where to begin contributing to SportsDrop? You can start by looking through the three main sub-projects:

> **sportsdrop_mobile** - contains android/ios related source code for the mobile portion of the application
> **sportsdrop_server** - contains javascript/nodejs related source code for the server portion of the application
> **sportsdrop_web** - contains html/css/js related source code for the web side of the application

# Getting started
### How to submit a contribution.

* You are in charge of your own branch. Writing your own README files, testing methods, additional packages is entirely up to you.
* We advise you create your own contribution files if your project changes drastically to the base.
* If your have your own Github repository, we don't mind you forking this repository over to your own Github space [1]

[1] ALL WE ASK IS THAT YOU CREDIT THE ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTOR, I.E. CREATOR OF THE DEFAULT CODE BASE PROJECT @
